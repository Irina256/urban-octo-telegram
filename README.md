Marketing Agency needed a codebase that follows accessibility standards

_Aim of that project was to refactor the code according to ##Acceptance criteria:_

GIVEN a webpage meets accessibility standards
WHEN I view the source code
THEN I find semantic HTML elements
WHEN I view the structure of the HTML elements
THEN I find that the elements follow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning
WHEN I view the image elements
THEN I find accessible alt attributes
WHEN I view the heading attributes
THEN they fall in sequential order
WHEN I view the title element
THEN I find a concise, descriptive title

The following image shows the web application's appearance and functionality:
